 On the other hand, if the two sockets have a total of sixteen cores and you define

OMP_PLACES=cores
OMP_PROC_BIND=close

then

    thread 0 goes to core 0, which is on socket 0,
    thread 1 goes to core 1, which is on socket 0,
    thread 2 goes to core 2, which is on socket 0,
    and so on, until thread 7 goes to core 7 on socket 0, and
    thread 8 goes to core 8, which is on socket 1,
    et cetera.
